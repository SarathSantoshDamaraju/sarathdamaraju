Usage of terminal is one of the best things a programmer does. It makes us feel like a little hacker playing around (at-least to me ;D ) with his cozy tool. We write little tools (when ever possible) to automate small tasks or cut the pain of typing a very long commands.

`git` has the awesome feature of writing your own aliases to commands. I like it a lot and written a set of aliases that I use everyday (I call them `short-codes`) and I wanted to share them hoping to-be useful to others.

And it starts here ..

These are the list of aliases that I use everyday.

If you feel they are helpful, you can create your own aliases with the above list. **I have also created a `git` [repo](https://github.com/SarathSantoshDamaraju/lazyGit) with detailed instructions to install and use them**. Make sure to reopen your terminal to see the changes.

> Iâ€™d recommend beginners to learn and understand actual commands before using any tools/aliases for `git`.
