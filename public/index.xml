      <description>Usage of terminal is one of the best things a programmer does. It makes us feel like a little hacker playing around (at-least to me ;D ) with his cozy tool. We write little tools (when ever possible) to automate small tasks or cut the pain of typing a very long commands.
git has the awesome feature of writing your own aliases to commands. I like it a lot and written a set of aliases that I use everyday (I call them short-codes) and I wanted to share them hoping to-be useful to others.</description>
