    <p>Usage of terminal is one of the best things a programmer does. It makes us feel like a little hacker playing around (at-least to me ;D ) with his cozy tool. We write little tools (when ever possible) to automate small tasks or cut the pain of typing a very long commands.</p>

<p><code>git</code> has the awesome feature of writing your own aliases to commands. I like it a lot and written a set of aliases that I use everyday (I call them <code>short-codes</code>) and I wanted to share them hoping to-be useful to others.</p>

<p>And it starts here ..</p>

<p>These are the list of aliases that I use everyday.
<a href="https://gist.github.com/SarathSantoshDamaraju/3e1e85e2c3a8c3b3ccb5cbac937f2bef">https://gist.github.com/SarathSantoshDamaraju/3e1e85e2c3a8c3b3ccb5cbac937f2bef</a></p>

<p>If you feel they are helpful, you can create your own aliases with the above list. <strong>I have also created a <code>git</code> <a href="https://github.com/SarathSantoshDamaraju/lazyGit">repo</a> with detailed instructions to install and use them</strong>. Make sure to reopen your terminal to see the changes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’d recommend beginners to learn and understand actual commands before using any tools/aliases for <code>git</code>.</p>
