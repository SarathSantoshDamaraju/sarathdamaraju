## PROFESSIONAL ADVICE


### It is OK to be a mediocre 

Dear younger me, You are a fresh grad out of college and you know stuff and you may not be great at them, so what, that's enough, to begin with. You may not be that nerdy kid who is better at programming from age 10 and truth is you won’t ever be.
But you are good if you give your best at what you do and improve over time.


### Speak Out

Dear younger me, I know you are just 20 and you don’t feel good offending anyone or anything. That's good, but voicing your thoughts won’t hurt anyone as much as it does you when you don’t.
Why? 

You may have to negotiate your next job
You need to speak out what is bothering you.
You need to speak out what works and doesn’t work for you.
You need to appreciate and speak out when someone gives you constructive criticism and give them back if it is just criticism.

and none of these happens unless you SPEAK OUT


### Money is as important as Excellence.

Dear younger me, I know you are very much inspired by 3-idiots and I know you very much believe in —


> "Don’t run behind success. Follow behind excellence, success will come all way behind you.”

Well, in the real world, success is just a single word for a group of things, agree or disagree, mostly depended on a factor -- “Money”.

So my advice, run behind excellence and success. And you will definitely see they complement each other when balanced.


### Learn to show off

Dear younger me, Let me tell you a secret ingredient to be successful - “Showing off”.

How do I know, well I am 5 yrs older than you and have probably seen hundreds of posts where people “show off” their work.

Point is, the world around you is running, constantly and it is practically impossible for someone (especially in the professional life) to slow down and observe what have you accomplished unless you “show off”.

So, Make some noise and share your experience.


### Choose Work, Company, and Boss

Dear younger me, if someone tells you - “choose your boss over anything” tell them that's bullshit. 

How do you know that person without joining the company or interaction? And a few minutes discussion over call definitely won’t justify that.


- Choose, the Work or Domain or Stream or whatever you be doing at the company.
- Choose a company that fits your career goal.

And Boss is definitely important, but with unhappy work and an unsuitable company, he won’t be of much help too either.


## PERSONAL
Health is [Wealth, Success, Happiness]

Heading easy it all.

Dear younger me, Let me break it for you —“Life is short and health is fragile”. And with out health other three don’t make much sense. So, spend as much time, or even more time you spend in front of a screen on your health.


### Learn to say NO

Dear younger me, by the time when you turn 24 you would have read at least a dozen blogs on “how to say NO” and you realize reading those blogs over a hundred times again is much easier than actually saying NO.

It’s hard and whenever you try to test your luck with it, your emotions will start playing the blame game with you.

“Saying NO to smoking or drinking will make my friend abandon me”
“Saying No to an underpaid job will affect your career, at least you will have a job”
“Saying NO to buying a Fancy Flat or Premium Car would isolate me from the society”

Yeah, your emotions use all tricks under sleeve to say you not to say NO.

Irrespective of you saying NO or not, people will stay only If they want to. So, saying a simple NO occasionally won’t hurt you and definitely won’t isolate you.


### Push the Boundaries

Dear younger me, If I have to choose two rules to stick with forever. This would definitely be one amongst. So, I want you to start early on it.

So push the boundaries by Exploring stuff, Visiting places, Meeting random people, doing crazy things, Taking risks, Learning things and Moving ON.


### Stay away from BS

Its simple Funda — “Keep yourself away from people, stuff or anything that you would this is BS.”
That's all !!


### Don’t forget people and to smile

As every day goes by, we get old and so are our family and friends. Spend quality of time with them. Because once gone these people are hard to get back (going senti. Aren’t I ?). 

So, dear younger me, meet them often, crack stupid jokes, laugh over silly things, do crazy things, talk over politics or life, share stuff, have some moments and do spend quality time with these people.

And finally, life is a roller coaster ride, packed with bumps, surprises, twists, turns, setbacks, and victories. And dear younger me ride through them with a smile on your face.

Cheers 
-KD
